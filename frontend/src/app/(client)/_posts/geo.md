## Abstract

Geothermal energy has long been constrained by the necessity of high-temperature resources for efficient power generation. This research unveils a groundbreaking technology that enables the effective use of low-temperature geothermal resources, significantly expanding the potential for geothermal power production. By leveraging advanced thermodynamic cycles and novel materials for heat exchange, the developed system can operate at temperatures as low as 90°C, making previously uneconomical geothermal resources viable for energy production. Field tests confirm the system's efficiency and robustness, indicating a major leap forward in geothermal technology that could transform the energy landscape.
