## Abstract

Addressing the environmental impact of traditional hydroelectric systems, this research introduces a novel micro-hydro generator that minimizes ecological disruption while providing a sustainable and reliable source of energy. The design focuses on a modular, scalable system that can be integrated into existing waterways without large dams, thus preserving aquatic ecosystems. Pilot installations demonstrate the system's capability to generate power efficiently across a variety of flow conditions, offering a versatile solution to hydroelectric energy generation. The study emphasizes the balance between energy production and environmental conservation, proposing a new direction for hydroelectric technology.



## Key Findings

Introduction of a low-impact, micro-hydro generator that integrates seamlessly into natural waterways.
Successful pilot installations demonstrate efficient power generation in diverse flow conditions.
A sustainable approach to hydroelectric power that prioritizes ecological preservation.
