## Abstract

This study presents the design and testing of a new wind turbine capable of operating efficiently in low-wind conditions, common in many parts of the world. The innovative blade design, inspired by biomimicry principles, allows for increased torque at lower wind speeds, thus enhancing the overall efficiency and power output of wind turbines in less windy environments. These take concepts similar to hummingbirds' wings and other parts of nature. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and field tests confirm the effectiveness of the new design, showing a 25% increase in power generation at wind speeds below 3.5 m/s. This research could significantly expand the viability of wind energy projects in regions previously considered unsuitable due to low average wind speeds.


## Key Findings

-Development of a wind turbine blade design that increases efficiency in low-wind conditions.
-A 25% increase in power generation at wind speeds below 3.5 m/s.
-Potential for expansion of wind energy projects into low-wind regions, increasing renewable energy accessibility.
