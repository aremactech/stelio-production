## Abstract

Recent advancements in solar technology have led to the development of a novel quantum dot-integrated photovoltaic (PV) cell that significantly increases the efficiency of solar energy conversion. This research introduces a new class of quantum dots capable of broad-spectrum absorption, effectively harnessing a larger portion of the solar spectrum compared to traditional PV cells. By implementing these quantum dots into silicon-based solar cells, we have achieved a record-breaking efficiency of 33.7%, surpassing the current maximum for silicon PV cells. The study outlines the fabrication process, theoretical framework, and experimental results that demonstrate the potential of quantum dot technology in enhancing solar energy systems.

## Key Findings
