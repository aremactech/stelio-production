  <p className="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400 text-sm">
    Senior Software Engineer, 2018 — 2020
  </p>
  <p>
    Hy-Vee, an almost 100-year-old grocery chain in the United States,
    wanted to build a new version of their digital storefront. I joined a
    team of <Link href="/blog/product-engineers">product engineers</Link>{' '}
    working across web and mobile to rebuild their legacy .NET application
    (~500k MAU) with React and React Native.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the frontend, I led our move from a custom webpack and React
    configuration to Next.js and the latest React patterns. In the
    process, I shared my learnings online, helping educate members of the
    React and Next.js community by creating courses.
  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout my two years, I was able to work on some hard problems:
    decoupling a decade old monolith into microservices, working with a
    federated GraphQL API, learning and occasionally managing a Kubernetes
    cluster, building and implementing a design system, incrementally
    migrating individual components and routes to a new framework and
    infrastructure, and more.

    Workiva ($WK) is a cloud platform for data reporting and compliance.
    During my time at Workiva, I gained my first production experience
    using React. I worked on tooling to help predict and alert and
    regressions in our SaaS platform, building a product similar to
    open-source tools like Sentry.
